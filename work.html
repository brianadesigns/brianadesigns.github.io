          <p>AHR is a company responsible for producing helmets and helmet accessories for your everyday motor-bike riding and more. This campaign in particular features a catalog containing all of their helmets sorted by catagory, a die-cut mailer in the shape of one of their helmets, and a tradeshow display piece. Adobe: Illustrator was used to re-create the AHR logo and to layout the die-cut mailer. Adobe: Photoshop was used to make the entirety of the tradeshow piece, as well as to edit and crop out the backgrounds on the helmets featured in the catalog and the helmet used for the mailer. Adobe: InDesign was used to layout the catalog.</p>
